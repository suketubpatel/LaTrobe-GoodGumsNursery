Adult leaves square measure lance-shaped to arced, principally 80–110 millimetre (3.1–4.3 in) long and 15–25 millimetre (0.6–1 in) wide on a leafstalk 10–35 millimetre (0.39–1.4 in) long. The flower buds square measure organized in leaf axils in teams of 3 on AN branchless peduncle 15–35 millimetre (0.59–1.4 in) long, the individual flowers on pedicels 15–22 millimetre (0.59–0.87 in) long. Mature flower buds square measure oval or pear-shaped, coated with a whitish waxy bloom, 17–30 millimetre (0.67–1.2 in) long and 10–13 millimetre (0.39–0.51 in) wide with a conelike plate. Flowering in the main happens between might and Sep and also the flowers have pink stamens with yellow anthers on the tip. The fruit may be a woody convex or urn-shaped capsule 15–25 millimetre (0.59–0.98 in) long and 18–23 millimetre (0.71–0.91 in) wide on a peduncle 13–33 millimetre (0.51–1.3 in) long.

The flower buds square measure organized on the ends of branchlets on a branched peduncle 15–32 millimetre (0.59–1.26 in) long, every branch of the peduncle with seven buds on pedicels 13–27 millimetre (0.51–1.06 in) long. Mature buds square measure oval to pear-shaped, 12–18 millimetre (0.47–0.71 in) long and 6–8 millimetre (0.24–0.31 in) wide with a rounded to planate plate. Flowering happens from Gregorian calendar month to could and also the flowers square measure bright red to pink or orange.

The name was unusable because of that combination having been used for one more species.[5] It gained its current binomial name in 1893 once reclassified within the dicot genus by German life scientist Franz Josef Niedenzu,[1] and since 2009 the Council of Heads of Australasian Herbaria (CHAH) Australian Plant Census has confirmed the popularity of this current name. The species has been wide better-known for several years as Acmena smithii, still employed in office as of 2009, in Qld presently as of Gregorian calendar month 2013, and it still happens nowadays on several older websites. <br />

                        Common names embrace lilly pilly, coast satinash, Eungella gum, and within the timber trade, lilipilli satinash.[4]

The rootstock permits the species to regenerate when drought or fireplace. every plant could turn out over 350 flowers, on up to ten long stems, these seem throughout the summer of the region. spore is distributed by birds as they plunge into the flowers to succeed in the nectaries.
